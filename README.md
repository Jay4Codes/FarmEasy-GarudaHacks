# Case Study: FIR
Indonesia being a major producer of agricultural products Farmers form the backbone of country. But they are the ones who suffer a lot too due to many factors like not good income, not getting paid as much they deserve and other things because of which they are unable to buy good and enough pesticides, insecticides, fertilisers etc. leading to poor crop quality. While on the other hand other people were getting benefited. This disheartened us and inspired us that we should do something for the farmers.

# What we do?
FarmEasy is a web application that helps farmers as well as industries that use farm waste as their raw materials. The farmer uploads the photo of the waste along with information like its type and quantity of the waste for which they will get tokens froms us in return. Then we will collect the waste and sell it to the industries and by the money that we got we will buy some products like insecticides, pesticides, fertilisers, etc. and display on our website. The waste and products both will be displayed in their respective pages of waste store and product store. Now the farmer can view these products and buy the ones whichever they require using the tokens we gave them in return of waste. This will help farmers improve their crop quality and yield without spending too much extra money. Hence it will be profitable for them as well as the industries as they are getting their raw matrials.
